                    <h5>Commerce in Today's Era</h5>


        <p> In this volatile era of society, digital revolution is altering
          the way in which we consume, communicate, and retrieve information
           and much like species, businesses must adapt to survive. </p>

        <p>The “Fourth Industrial Revolution” is already here. And like any
          revolution, it brings with it profound change. New technologies will be
          the cornerstones of this transformation and will impact production models,
          manpower, relationships with consumers, etc. Artificial Intelligence
          (AI), machine learning, big data, 3D and 4D printers, 5G, Virtual Reality,
          blockchain, Augmented Reality and the Internet of Things (IoT) are among
          the technologies that will mark our present and our future.</p>

                        </div>

     <div class="col-md-6">
&nbsp
     <p>In order to survive the fourth Industrial Revolution, we need to analyze
        what is happening, and adapt quickly. In this sense, we are referring
        to Digital Darwinism. As Charles Darwin quotes "it is not the strongest
        species that survive, nor the most intelligent, it the one that is most
        adaptable to change. "and although this quotes from Darwin in regard to
        adaption amongst species, the theory is relevant and can be used world of
        business. Amplifying the need for businesses and people to adapt to new
        situations arising due to the demand of digitalization. Failure to
        adapt results in low of survival. Ultimately, business that suffer are
        ones businesses who fail to adapt and as a result, get left behind. </p>

       <h2>Uncertainty of Brick and Mortar</h2>

            		<p>Within the past two decades, traditional brick
                  and mortar retail has suffered exponentially by
                  the cultural and technological changes due to the
                   invention and rise of the internet. Retail
                   analysts predicted online shopping would be the
                   death of brick and mortar retailers. The declining
                    sales, reduced footfall interactions, and massive
                     rent increases have supported this theory. </p>

                <p>From 2010, begin to see what is now known as the
                  “retail apocalypse”, where thousands of american
                  traditional brick and mortar stores are shutting down
                  and closing for good and now this fall of traditional
                  commerce has been increasing at an alarming rate. More
                  than 9,300 stores closed in 2019 alone, this was a 60%
                  jump from the 5,844 stores that closed in 2018. At this
                  rate, It is predicted that another 75,000 stores will
                  disappear by 2026 according to UBS. With major and once
                  prominent retailers such as toys r us, payless, and
                  gymboree closing all of its stores.</p>

                  <h2>Rise of Ecommerce</h2>

                  <p>Within the last decade, the percentage of retail sales in the
                     U.S. that have come from ecommerce has increased by nearly 300%,
                      from 3.3% to 9.7%. Ecommerce has been going at a phenomenal
                      rate with no shortstop insight and amid Covid-19, In a recently
                      conducted survey, 80% of the internet using population has
                      purchased something from an eCommerce’s store and 50% of the
                      internet using population purchased something online more than once.</p>

                  <p>Mobile ecommerce is also growing rapidly. Between the year 2013
                     to 2017, mobile ecommerce had grown 213% within just the four year
                      span! When you consider the fact that less than 50% of the global
                       population are using phones, the potential for mobile e-commerce
                        will only grow.</p>

   <div class="col-md-6">


  <p>To many physical retailers, the secret to avoiding possible failure is by providing customer centric ethics to your business model and many of these customer centric tactics involve the incorporation of digital technology. if traditional retailers hope to survive, they have to turn the one big feature that internet retailers lack and &mdash;stores&mdash;from a liability into an asset. Research shows that physical stores boost online purchases. Considering the fact, Brick-and-mortar&rsquo;s redeeming attributes is that customers can physically interact with products and take them home right away, which also happens to be e-commerce&rsquo;s biggest con. In contrast, online shopping&rsquo;s number one feature is its convenience, predictability and ability to open 24/7 virtually anywhere across the world, this being where physical retail fails. The incorporation of both a Digital and physical presence to create a near perfect experience, online and offline could be the ultimate saving grace for many brick and mortar stores.</p>

  <p><strong>Digital Transformation</strong></p>


  <p>Digital transformation might be the secret to the collapse of brick-and-mortar. As technology becomes a permanent fixture in everyday life, companies are forced to update technological methodologies to keep up with customer demands and the evolving worlds of commerce around them. For example, Macy's and Home Depot incorporated RDIF Technology to help customers easily navigate store aisles and find what they are looking for and as a result reported substantial revenue increases the following year. These hybrid stores will represent both the past and the future Commerce and ultimately represent an end to the Battle of brick-and-mortar versus e-commerce, and Constitute the beginning of the interconnected age of retail.</p>
