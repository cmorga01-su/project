                  <h2>Study your Target Audience</h2>
                    <p>One of the most important aspects of strategic marketing
                       is determining your audience. What type of people are
                       interested in your product or service? What age range,
                       gender, profession, career, etc.. By defining your audience
                        you're saving time and money marketing to a precise
                        population of people interested in your service or product
                        and most importantly structuring a recipe for success.
                        When you define your audience and learn more about their
                        behaviors as they purchase, it helps you create the
                        ultimate audience that will buy from you every time.</p>

                    <h2>Partner with Influencers</h2>
                    <p>2.Utilizing Influencer marketing has been an increasingly popular
                       method due to the effects it can have on your business. Gymshark
                       started in the back of a garage to a billion-dollar company primarily
                      because of this marketing Strategy. This increasing demand for
                      influencer marketing is based on the fact, Influencers are more
                      likely to convert to their audience because the trust is already
                      built. Companies that aren’t known tend to lose potential customers
                      due to lack of trust. By incorporating influencer marketing, you
                      can bypass the customers who may not trust your brand when using
                      an influencer to promote your product or service.  </p>

                       from a shopper perspective to buying what you NEED rather than buying
                        what you want. Consumers are less likely to nickel and dime a service
                         or product they need or that will benefit them but will think
